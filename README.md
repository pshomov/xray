## History and vision

The idea for this library came after the awesome course 'Growing real systems guided by tests' by [Nat Pryce](http://natpryce.com), here in Reykjavik, Iceland. The examples were all in Java and there was no similar supporting libraries for .NET. This is an attempt at covering that area.

## Dependencies

Xray is using the great [NHamcrest](http://github.com/grahamrhay/NHamcrest). That library can be used of course standalone for more expressive and powerful assertions in tests.
